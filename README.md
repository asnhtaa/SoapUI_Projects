# SoapUI_Projects

## Description
This project contains SoapUI tests for testing SOAP&REST-based web services. SoapUI is a powerful tool that allows us to design, build, and execute functional and performance tests on SOAP web services. In this project, we validate the functionalities and interactions of various SOAP&REST APIs to ensure their reliability and correctness.
